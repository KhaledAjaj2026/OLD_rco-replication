# RCO_replication
A frontend project, testing my ability in replicating existing UI designs. This project focuses on building and sharpening my styling skills by building the homepage for a professional website.
## Lessons Learned
My first e-commerce storefront project. Really enjoyed testing out CSS features to find the most reasonable solutions to layout. Got to expand my knowledge in SASS by implementing nested selectors inside deeply nested HTML elements, such as lists and menus.

Needed to learn about specificity in order to properly style a long homepage with many components. Had to learn about SASS nesting and its inability to nest pseudo-classes, and instead used specific class names to correctly target the desired element/s.
## Potential Future Features
- Responsive styling, implementing media queries to create a seamless experience across multiple screen sizes.
- Making the "100% Vegan Formulas" items scroll to the left as the viewport scrolls down.
- New pages: Products, About, secondary site (R+CO Bleu).
## Deployment
This site was deployed using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This site was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/).
